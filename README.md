# Task_List_Application
A c++ application built with RAD studio, used to add/delete tasks. 


#If you wish to try out this app you can go [here](https://github.com/KA1PE5H/Task_List_Application/blob/main/src/Win32/Debug/Project1.exe) :)

Note:
One functionality that I have added is to check if the Input is empty or not, this way when a task is added it wont store it in the task list displayed.
